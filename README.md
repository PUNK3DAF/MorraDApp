# Summary
- This is a decentralized application (DApp) for playing the classic game of Morra. The game involves two players, who simultaneously show a number of fingers, and the sum of the fingers shown is used to determine the winner. Players can make their moves by choosing a number between 0 and 5. The player who correctly guesses the total sum of fingers wins the round. Morra is a game of strategy, psychology, and probability, and can be played for fun or as a gambling game. In modern times, Morra has been adapted into various digital versions, including DApps, which allow players to compete against each other on the blockchain.
# Installation
- To get the game up and running, you must first have Reach, Ubuntu, Docker Desktop, and Visual Studio Code installed on your computer. After that, create a new folder containing the Reach file and clone the Morra DApp repository. Open the newly created folder in Visual Studio Code, and then launch two Ubuntu terminals. In each terminal, type the command "export REACH_CONNECTOR_MODE=ALGO" followed by "./reach run". Once both terminals are running, follow the in-game instructions to start playing.
# Run instructions
- To play the game, two players are needed. One player should choose to play as Andrew, and the other as Blake. Both players must create an account by answering 'y' when prompted to do so. The Andrew player should send a contract string, such as {"type":"BigNumber","hex":"0x04"}, to the Blake player, who should paste it into their terminal when prompted. After that, simply follow the instructions provided by the game to play.
